# Meal Planner (Google Sheets)

A lightweight 4-week meal planning system built in Google Sheets using Google Apps Script.  
This tool focuses on **planning and organization**, not recipe storage.

It helps you decide *what* you’re eating without managing full recipes.

---

## ✨ What This Tool Does

- Generates **4 weeks of meals** automatically  
- Supports **Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, and Dinner**
- Prevents repeating the same meal within a week
- Uses a **simple recipe name system**, not full recipes
- Allows optional **side dishes**
- Includes a clean, color-coded **calendar view**
- Allows quick meal swaps using dropdowns

---

## ⚠️ Important: About the Recipe Database

This tool **does not store full recipes**.

The “Recipes” sheet is intentionally minimal and only contains:
- Recipe name  
- Category (Chicken, Beef, Vegetarian, etc.)
- Meal type checkboxes (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks)
- Optional “Side” flag  

Think of it as a **meal name index**, not a cookbook.

You are expected to:
- Keep actual recipes elsewhere (cookbook, notes app, website, etc.)
- Use this planner to decide *what* you’re making, not *how*
